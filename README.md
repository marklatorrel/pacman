##PACMEN EXERCISE

Description of project
This is a first version of the PACMAN GAME that includes the Pacman identifying the borders and changing direction according to it. I included an animation of the pacman eating.

How to run
You only need to clone the repository and run the Index.html code on any web browser.

Roadmap of future
The next implementation would be changing the pacman from a picture to a creation in CSS itself, that would allow me to change the characteristics of the Pacmen and make it more personalized.

Usage
The are two buttons, with Add PacMan you should see the pacmen appear in random positions. With Start Game you will see them move.
