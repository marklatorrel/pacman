# PACMAN EXERCISE

## Description of project
This is a first version of the PACMAN GAME that includes the Pacman identifying the borders and changing direction according to it. I included an animation of the pacman eating.

## How to run
You only need to clone the repository and run the Index.html code on any web browser.

## Roadmap of future
The next implementation would be changing the pacman from a picture to a creation in CSS itself, that would allow me to change the characteristics of the Pacmen and make it more personalized.

## Usage
The are two buttons, with Add PacMan you should see the pacmen appear in random positions. With Start Game you will see them move.
